"‚ÄúBut the room that seems to represent the most change in the couple‚Äôs life is the baby‚Äôs.‚Ä®‚Ä®In it, an embroidered daybed faces a wicker bassinet, which is draped with an antique lace skirt and hood. The windows overlook the playhouse that Shinn built in the property‚Äôs back garden over a century ago. Emily is obsessed with labelling the infant‚Äôs clothing, sorting through family heirlooms, and vintage or antique pieces that she has collected over the decades. After all, this moment marks a new chapter in the couple‚Äôs lives ‚Äì when their family histories are now permanently joined. ‚ÄòMy mom saved all our childhood clothes,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI always found clothing and objects ‚Äì especially from past generations ‚Äì incredibly inspiring to me.

"Material Evidence feature in The World of Interiors by Thessaly La Force.

‚ÄúA procession of French animal terrines bought in Paris, a trio of photographs from the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh and the owners‚Äô drinks bar all find a home in this alcove, which is topped with a pelmet of antique chintz.‚Äù

The pelmet is a hand-stitched chintz block print circa 1850 from France. In the right corner is a Savoie region pitcher circa 1890s, hydrangeas from our house outside the city, and a grouping of celluloid storks. I collected celluloid storks from the 1930s-1950s leading up to the birth of our baby girl. I used them at my baby shower and in and around the home, where they landed at here at the bar.

‚ÄúLately, there‚Äôs been lots of conversations regarding the ways in which women designers approach making clothes for women; oftentimes, the focus is on the fact that they design for women‚Äôs ‚Äòreal lives‚Äô meaning wearable, meaning comfortable, meaning suited for a wide range of bodies. Beyond all this, Bode Aujla is also tapping into women‚Äôs fantasies; their desire to wear beautiful and devastating things just for themselves. If anyone happens to join in their fun, well, that‚Äôs a bonus.‚Äù

"The FW24 collection, Bode Recreation, is now available to preview on Vogue Runway. Review by Laia Garcia-Furtado

‚ÄúFor fall 2024, Emily Adams Bode Aujla is introducing a new line with a sportswear bend called Bode Recreation. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs our interpretation of American athletic wear, largely inspired from the 1770s through the 1970s, and it‚Äôs the first time that we‚Äôre introducing certain materials more focused on washability and wearability,‚Äô she said at the label‚Äôs sprawling new headquarters in lower Manhattan.‚Äù

The Fall 2024 collection reimagines leisure and athletic apparel from the 1770s-1970s and speaks to the American commitment to sports and recreation as vital to our understanding of virtue, community, and national history.

"Our Garden State Shirt is inspired by a midcentury novelty tablecloth, produced as a souvenir during the post-war tourism boom. This historical reproduction features printed illustrations of New Jersey landmarks, activities, and motifs. Available in long sleeve or short sleeve, online and in stores.

By the early 1930s, the Great Depression had devastated the tourist trade in the United States. As a result, regional entrepreneurs began aggressively advertising roadside tourist attractions and developed new novelty products to sell as souvenirs. Barth & Dreyfuss dominated the market for souvenir linens from the 1930s-1950s, manufacturing colorful maps with regional motifs on canvas burlap known as ‚Äúcactus cloth‚Äù.

Following World War II, the tourism industry grew rapidly. Interstate highways were improved and the U.S. economy was prosperous. An increasing number of American households owned automobiles allowing families to travel freely. The development of motor courts, motels, national parks, resorts, and theme parks resulted in myriad vending locations from which colorful souvenirs could be marketed and sold.

Souvenir tablecloths reached peak popularity during the late-1940s and early-1950s. Many of these textiles were state-themed, though some designs were centered around specific tourist destinations or major metropolitan cities.",/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/BODE IG Photos/3161342663877130614_17952249.jpg,/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/BODE IG Photos/3161342663860194485_17952249.jpg,/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/BODE IG Photos/3161342663843590151_17952249.jpg,/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/BODE IG Photos/3161342663843427303_17952249.jpg,,,,4954,4,12,bode
