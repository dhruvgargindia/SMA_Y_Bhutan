bode,"While visiting Nike‚Äôs archive, I was particularly drawn to photographs that Jeff Johnson, also known as Employee #1, took of female student-athletes at Hayward Field, the University of Oregon‚Äôs track-and-field stadium in Eugene. This image is inspired by one of Johnson‚Äôs historic photos‚Äîof a runner tying back her hair with a ribbon before a race.

bode,"@wwd ‚ÄúA lot of her research at Nike‚Äôs Beaverton, Ore., campus, in family archives and history books ‚Äúhad to do with the rise of sports through high schools, colleges and boarding schools,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIn 1903, the Public Schools Athletic League transformed what sports are to America and tied them to having a virtuous child, and building body and mind. And the foundation of Nike had a lot of those key ideas, too. Even employee number one, Jeff Johnson, was a coach, [as was cofounder Bill Bowerman, Oregon‚Äôs track coach] and the way to coach kids is to make them better people more than just athletes,‚Äù she said.‚Äù - Booth Moore",3536,15,,2
bode,"@gq ‚ÄúJohnson, Nike‚Äôs very-first full-time employee, recalls the Astro Grabber hitting his desk around early 1972. ‚ÄúThat one, it was just such a sexy looking shoe,‚Äù he says. And in typical Bode fashion, the project involves quite a bit of storytelling. Which is where Johnson‚Äîone of the most fascinating characters in the chronicle of American footwear, the man who literally coined the name ‚ÄúNike‚Äù‚Äîcomes in.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf Knight was the brains of the operation that became Nike, Johnson was the heart, bringing a level of obsession to the idea of marketing and selling sneakers that carried the fledgling company through countless rough patches. ‚ÄúI was the only guy‚Äù at the beginning, Johnson told me. ‚ÄúSo I was sweeping the floors, going to the docks to get the shoes, marketing, everything all by myself.‚Äù‚Äô - Samuel Hine

bode,"My dad graduated high school in Massachusetts in June of 1971. His senior year as co-captain and defensive tackle, and the three years of playing football prior, shaped his character for the rest of his life.

This same year, Nike was tasked with developing a football shoe to solve the problem of astroturf, a new synthetic turf that was only just recently being used on Pac 12 football fields (USC, UCLA, U of O).

The collection we are releasing with Nike, on bode.com April 18th at 6pm, exhibits my shared belief of the American commitment to sports and recreation as vital to our understanding of virtue, community, and national history. For this project I explored the early stories of Nike by way of their Oregon archives and through multiple conversations with employee number one, Jeff Johnson. 

Billboard featuring my dad, 1971. I want to thank Department of Nike Archives, the Nike and Bode teams, Eric Wrenn, George Cortina, Cerruti Draime, and Midland Agency.

‚ÄúLately, there‚Äôs been lots of conversations regarding the ways in which women designers approach making clothes for women; oftentimes, the focus is on the fact that they design for women‚Äôs ‚Äòreal lives‚Äô meaning wearable, meaning comfortable, meaning suited for a wide range of bodies. Beyond all this, Bode Aujla is also tapping into women‚Äôs fantasies; their desire to wear beautiful and devastating things just for themselves.

bode,"Our Garden State Shirt is inspired by a midcentury novelty tablecloth, produced as a souvenir during the post-war tourism boom. This historical reproduction features printed illustrations of New Jersey landmarks, activities, and motifs. Available in long sleeve or short sleeve, online and in stores.

By the early 1930s, the Great Depression had devastated the tourist trade in the United States. As a result, regional entrepreneurs began aggressively advertising roadside tourist attractions and developed new novelty products to sell as souvenirs. Barth & Dreyfuss dominated the market for souvenir linens from the 1930s-1950s, manufacturing colorful maps with regional motifs on canvas burlap known as ‚Äúcactus cloth‚Äù.

Following World War II, the tourism industry grew rapidly. Interstate highways were improved and the U.S. economy was prosperous. An increasing number of American households owned automobiles allowing families to travel freely. The development of motor courts, motels, national parks, resorts, and theme parks resulted in myriad vending locations from which colorful souvenirs could be marketed and sold.

Souvenir tablecloths reached peak popularity during the late-1940s and early-1950s. Many of these textiles were state-themed, though some designs were centered around specific tourist destinations or major metropolitan cities.",4954,12,,4
