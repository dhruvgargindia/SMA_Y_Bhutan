"Meaning of Norlha -  Nor is wealth, a word tied to the Buddhist concepts predominant in Tibetan culture, whose meaning can spell out infinite connotations and extensions that go far beyond material wealth. In the Tibetan ethos, the accumulation of positive deeds and the ensuing merit is weighed as seriously as that of collecting material wealth. Tibetans spend their lives preparing for the next, cultivating spiritual wealth to attain a positive rebirth, a predominant concern for all.

Nor can be translated as jewels or wealth, it’s also the word used in Tibet for yaks. Lha means God, which would give « the wealth of the Gods » or « the Gods of the yaks ».",/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/3322066644064453071_1580798609.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,3157,1,7,norlha_atelier

"The main edibles for life on the move were the Tibetan basics of tsampa, dried cheese, dried meat and butter. Except for butter that travelled in a wooden box, the other staples had little drawstring bags made of wool or skin, and would all be placed in a saddle bag for easy access. A full meal thus only required hot water, provided by a fire built on the road, lit with the flint stones that every man wore hanging from his belt. Since riding happened for hours at a time, most travelers also wore a necklace of hard cheese, which they chewed as they went along, to calm hunger until the next stop.

"Launching our latest collection of handmade scarves as ready to wear pieces inspired by the synergy between people and the natural world on the Tibetan Plateau.

For centuries, Tibetan nomads have nurtured a reciprocal relationship with the pastures and animals on whom they depend – guided by principles of care, respect and gratitude. These beliefs are the foundation of the nomads’ relationship with the yak, who provide communities with indispensable resources and are the backbone of their livelihoods.

The balance of colours in Norlha’s AW23 collections subtly references this fruitful coexistence. The RTW collection’s tonal browns, greys and greens reflect the muted shades of the pastures, while the highly pigmented yellows, pinks, oranges, blues and reds of the scarves and accessories nod towards the human presence on the plateau.

"In the small community of Ritoma, tradition and modernity coexist harmoniously. Children grow up in a safe environment surrounded by nature. They form close bonds with their neighbors, family, and clan members. The natural surroundings, including hills, caves, and pastures, serve as their playground. They engage in games like hide and seek, collect mushrooms, weave flower garlands during summer, and slide on frozen streams in winter. Their playful pursuits involve chasing marmots, interacting with baby yaks, and learning to ride horses at an early age. Additionally, they actively participate in religious and cultural festivals that form the heart of their village life. Despite the changing world, there remain places where childhood holds a nostalgic charm, even if they lack the comforts of city living.",/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/3148078476924522134_1580798609.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,2632,1,19,norlha_atelier

"Each year, at the height of summer, Ritoma pastors move their sheep and yak to Chakka, the furthest of the grazing areas, about 20 kilometers from Ritoma village. The pasture will be at its most lush, and a feast for the animals. Nomads arrange their tents in groups, usually on a southern facing slope, which gives them a view on the their flocks. At night, they gather the sheep into a pen near their tent to protect them from wolves, and tether the female yaks for their morning milking. The summer move is done in one go; in the past, yaks were loaded with the folded up tents, kitchen utensils and other daily necessities, but nowadays, the preferred vehicle is the three wheeler blue camel.

“Although I had felted sheep wool as a young woman, there was a big difference in the attention to detail with the Norlha designs,” says Ms Dolma Tso, a nomadic felter at Norlha since 2010. “I trained for four months.

"Spring Summer Collection ~ 

Water is both precious and plentiful on the Tibetan Plateau ­– a place of innumerable mineral springs, alpine lakes, glaciers, and the headwaters for many of Asia’s largest rivers. Rituals around water abound in Tibetan Buddhism, particularly yönchap – a daily water offering practiced in shrines and homes across the plateau. The symbolic significance of water in Tibetan Buddhism inspires Norlha’s ready-to-wear and scarves range for spring/summer 2023. Pieces featured within this collection are lightweight, flowing, and diaphanous – inspired by the Buddhist understanding of water as a symbol of purity, clarity, and calm.

Thank you to the incredible team for all the love and efforts put into making this a reality.",/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/3075045448896209936_1580798609.jpg,,/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/3075045448887809795_1580798609.jpg,,,,,,,,,1057,2,16,norlha_atelier
"Norlha’s soon to launch Spring/Summer collection was partly inspired by the symbolism of water in Tibetan culture. 

The Tibetan Plateau is the land of water, the place where Asia’s most important rivers, the Brahmaputra, Salween, Yangtse, Mekong and Indus, take their source and bring water from the Plateau south or east, several throughout the continent. It is the source of life for the millions who live beyond. 

As one of the 4 elements, water is precious and essential, though Tibetan culture has elevated it beyond its fundamental qualities. 

Before the launch of the new collection next week, we invite you to explore the role of water in Tibetan culture. Link in bio ~

"Felting is an ancient craft, a way of binding fibers to form fabrics and rugs for everyday use. It was highly developed among nomadic populations in Central Asia and the Caucasus where pieces over two thousand years old have been found. Among the nomads of Central Asia, felt, which is waterproof, provided shelter in the form of tents, clothing and rugs, many of which were intricately ornamented. 

As in all nomadic communities, felting was a part of daily existence, and every woman learned to felt the wool they sheared from their sheep, making mats and boots, which they colorfully decorated. We were lucky that so many people in Ritoma were talented felters. Norlha put yak felting on the map in 2012.

"Horses have always played an important role in Tibetan life. Historically, they’ve been used for travel, transport, status and sport. Spiritually, they symbolize the wind horse, harbinger of luck, the air that balances the four other elements, of wood, water, earth and fire. This symbolic horse appears printed on prayer flags or bits of paper to flap in or be tossed around by the wind on special occasions.

"Women’s day a day for reflection on the role, status and achievements of women in our world. Though Tibetan nomadic society is mostly patriarchal and male influence pervades, women’s role in society benefits from the status accorded to the female deities, enlightened beings and Bodhisattvas that abound in the Tibetan Buddhist pantheon, protecting and aiding practitioners on the path to enlightenment. The core purpose of Mahayana Buddhist practice is to renounce one’s personal welfare and seek to release all sentient beings from suffering. Tantric Buddhism provides the fastest path through the cultivation of wisdom, the female element, and compassion, the male one, which united into one will cause the attainment of this ultimate goal.

Female deities are said to appear in realized being’s visions and dreams, appearing in their lives in the guise of ordinary humans. Many are just born as women and can be recognized and revered, or just remain hidden, revealing their powers only when they choose to do so.

This pervading presence of deified or holy human females that permeates the culture at the esoteric level becomes a natural channel for women breaking barriers in society, especially today, when they gradually gain independence from their families and establish themselves in the work environment. In Ritoma, the home of the Norlha Atelier has seen local women take charge of their lives, giving a chance to those who cannot rely on their immediate families for support, adding another layer to female presence and capability.

"Around the yak, Norlha employees have learned not only to spin and weave, but taken on managerial positions in production, sales and other areas. Instead of herding the yak, they transform its fibre into a world class product, becoming linked to the world in the process. Young people meet at Norlha and have built their family life around their positions there. They live and thrive in the village of their origin, where they see their future. Their disposable income allows them to invest in better houses and education for their children. The yak is still the source of their livelihood; its continued presence and importance maintains a vital link between past and future.

Since its founding in 2007, Norlha has spent 40,000+ hours training local nomads in vocational, management & textile skills.

 ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པདྨེ་ཧཱུྃ

Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ is a praise to the four-armed Avalokiteshvara (translated as ‘the lord who looks in every direction’ or ‘the lord of what we see’), the Buddhist deity of infinite compassion and mercy. The mantra invokes ‘the jewel in the lotus’, the jewel being the wish fulfilling gem (or cintāmaṇi), and the lotus representing purity. Either spoken aloud or sounded internally, the mantra is believed to create a connection to Avalokiteshvara and induce a higher level of spiritual awareness.

In celebration of our community near and far, we wish to gift a selected participant and their friend a Buddha Blessing and Nomad Net Boiled Scarf (colour of your choice).

Hand-painted in copper sand ink on black paper by Lhagon Kyap, a local painter who specialises in thangkas (Tibetan religious scrolls), this blessing depicts the most recited and ubiquitous of all Buddhist mantras, oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ.

"November 13th, 2022 marks the completion of Norlha’s 15th year in Ritoma: Fifteen years ago, we pitched our work tents in the valley at the entrance of Ritoma village, marking the beginning of Norlha’s artisan training. As the trainees, all from pastoral backgrounds, familiarized themselves with flying shuttle looms and chakra spindles, the atelier was being built across the small dirt road from the tents. It was a unique spot, tucked in the flank of a hill looking south, facing the yak-dotted pasture and Ritoma’s highest and most revered peak, Amne Tongri. This was the start of our journey as the Norlha community.

Over the course of this journey, Norlha has survived a global economic crisis as well as three years of a global pandemic. Despite the challenges presented by the markets, we have managed to evolve from being a supplier to the world’s luxury markets to a representative of Positive Luxury. In 2019 we were officially recognized as a ‘Business as a Force for Good’ by B-corp. Since then we have received two awards for being ‘Best of the World’ in community from B-corp. Our success lies in the team we have  built  and the deep sense of trust and responsibility that we share. Today, 63% of our 96 local Ritoma village employees are women. As we mark  the close of our 15th year, we wish to acknowledge 20 among  our valued employees and artisans who have been with us for the past 15 years and with whom we have grown as a family and community.

"Stupa (Chorten in Tibetan) is an important religious monument in Tibet. This unique religious architectural form expresses significant religious symbolism and presents Buddha's physical presence.

The square base foundation, representing the Buddha's lotus throne, symbolizes earth, the state of solidity and five forces; faith, concentration, mindfulness, perseverance and wisdom. Above the base is a square or hexagon four stepped pedestal which represents The Buddha's crossed legs. Seated on the base is the cylinder, representing his torso. This symbolizes water, the state of fluidity and seven essential conditions of enlightenment: concentration, effort, equanimity, flexibility, mindfulness, joy and wisdom.

The crowning steeple, the Buddha's crown, is usually hand-made of brass and/or covered with gold leaf. It is segmented into 13 tapering rings, a parasol and a twin symbol of the sun and the moon. Those rings, representing fire and the thirteen steps of enlightenment, successively symbolize ten powers of the Buddha and three close contemplations. The stylized parasol, representing wind, wards off all evil. At the top of the steeple is the twin symbol of the sun and the moon, which represent wisdom and method respectively. A flaming jewel may be found atop the twin symbol, symbolizing the highest enlightenment.

"Choekhor Day ~ As autumn rolls in with yellowing and darkening skies, Ritoma’s pastoralists prepare for winter. Yak and sheep, which had been grazing at higher altitudes, come down and settle in the winter pasture, closer to the central village and the monastery. Each year, the time is marked by a blessing ritual meant to protect the animals over the winter. Men representing the village clans ride their horses to the monastery where they borrow a complete set of the Kangyur, 108 volumes of the Buddha’s teachings. They tie two to three each to their backs and ride off to circle the winter pastures, a 20 kilometer radius, that includes the sacred Amney Tongra, the mountain where the area's protector dwells. In doing this they bid both the forces of Buddhism and the local gods to protect them and their animals over the harsh months ahead. The circumambulation complete, they return to the monastery, tying their horses at the entrance, and solemnly march in, the volumes still tied to their backs to deliver them back. Winter life can now begin.

"The chuba, the Tibetan universal dress is a garment, found all over the Tibetan Plateau has roots deep in Central Asia, with early examples illustrated in the Dung Huang murals and scrolls from the Tangut Empire.

The chuba is a floor length, left crossing loose garment that is adjusted at the waist with a wide, usually red cloth belt, and pulled up to different degrees according to sex, rank or region. It is an extraordinarily adaptable garment worn by town dwellers, farmers, nomads, men and women alike and is equally wearable on horse or motorcycle. This explains its enduring, century-defying popularity over the whole of the Tibetan Plateau. Each generation had its style of wear, though nomads still like their sheepskin chubas for winter.

"~ “May the world enjoy boundless peace”

The Four Friends is a symbol of harmony. In the ancient times, before the coming of the Buddha, an elephant, a monkey, a hare and a grouse lived in the jungles of the Kingdom of Kashinagar, which is in present day Varanasi, in India. They lived in harmony, enjoying each other’s company. They decided that the source of happiness lay in respect for others, and wishing to share this revelation with the world, they set out to spread the word.

For World Peace Day, the Four Friends reminds us of the strength of the collective in creating a world where all can experience boundless peace, enjoying the happiness that emanates from a world free of conflict. Be kind, be compassionate and peace will follow. 

This blessing is hand-painted in copper sand ink on black paper by Lhagon Kyap, a local painter. The blessing can be added to any Norlha order.",/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/2932832380796520477_1580798609.jpg,,/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/2932832380796398977_1580798609.jpg,/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/2932832380788033578_1580798609.jpg,,,,,,,,386,3,1,norlha_atelier

"Launching our latest collection of luxurious yak wool garments and scarves informed by the dramatic seasonal transformations experienced in the Tibetan Plateau at this time of the year. As the frosty winter winds roll in from the north, autumn descends on the plateau. The moon rises early over the hills, the sky turns a piercing ice blue, and the moss green terrain becomes cloaked in deep snow. Nomads spend time outdoors immersed in wet conditions and cold temperatures, protected by large, heavy robes. This changing landscape that surrounds Norlha Atelier in Ritoma Village echoes across the new collection, featuring handmade and hand-treated items from soft yak down designed to cocoon and protect all winter long.

"New moon giveaway ~ Tibetan Picnics ~ NOW CLOSED

Picnics are at the core of the Tibetan concept of leisure, offering a source of enjoyment and relaxation during the summer months. This year, Norlha celebrated its annual picnic in mid-August. We set up camp in a beautiful meadow on the hill above the workshop, a winter grazing area for yak and sheep. In midsummer, this meadow is carpeted with wild flowers and offers a breathtaking view over the surrounding expanse of grassland. The three days featured its usual fare of games, singing and wonderful food with our local team. The weather was perfect and everyone, from big to small, had a wonderful time.

In celebration of our community near and far, we wish to gift a selected participant and their friend an Overflet Prince Scarf.

"Handspun blanket collection ~ Hand-spinning is a process that requires incredible dexterity, patience, speed and coordination. At Norlha, hand-spinning requires a particularly refined touch, as yak down fibre is much shorter than sheep’s wool and therefore more difficult to handle. A skilled spinner adopts a careful rhythm to coordinate the movements of their hands and feet at the wheel as they create a perfectly fine, even thread. The practice has historically been linked to mindfulness and meditation practices, and for many spinners at Norlha, spinning and reciting Buddhist prayers go hand in hand, as repeated mantras accompany their rhythmic movements. As Dolma Tso, a spinner at Norlha Atelier expresses: ‘Spinning has a soothing effect; like a river flowing, continuous, dependable and never-ceasing.’ Link in bio for full collection ~ Photo by @adam.j.barclay styled by @___lui___",/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/2894334624729733663_1580798609.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,1120,1,6,norlha_atelier
"Launching our Handspun Blanket collection soon ~ ‘Though the naked eye may find it difficult to differentiate a handspun thread from an industrial one, the former has qualities that the latter can hardly match.

Fine, handspun yak wool retains its pliability and smoothness – qualities that only mature with time.’ – Kim Yeshi, Norlha president and co-founder.

"Each year, monks in Labrang and many other monasteries on the Tibetan Plateau hold a six week retreat in the summer. Its origins are in the Monsoon Retreat that Buddha Shakyamuni established 2500 years ago. The heavy monsoon rain made it impractical for the Buddha and his followers to hold their daily walks to beg for their food as Monsoon was a time when the muddy footpaths and jungles teemed with insects. In a move to avoid trampling creatures and farmers vulnerable crops, the Buddha decided it was best to spend this time in a single place, in retreat.

Grown by young yak beneath their characteristic long, shaggy hair, khullu is the ultra-fine, downy undercoat that keeps them insulated during Tibet’s long, harsh winters and which they naturally shed every summer.

Khullu is the basis of Norlha and is used across our entire range. Carefully selected from thousands of animals across the Tibetan Plateau, our khullu is spun, woven and felted by local artisans at Norlha Atelier in Ritoma Village. The result is a luxurious textile with extraordinary insulating properties which will retain its shape, resist pilling and last long enough to pass on to the next generation.

The thread for this Handspun King Throw is masterfully handspun by a single artisan over the course of 22 days, ensuring the finest and softest yak wool thread possible.",/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/2882017235635904101_1580798609.jpg,,/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/2882017235627666680_1580798609.jpg,/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/2882017235627522981_1580798609.jpg,,,,,,,,455,3,0,norlha_atelier

By cheering to the gods with the cry of “Lha Gyalo” (May the Gods Win!) the men representing local clans and families call on the spirits to use their power against evil, protect them and bring on  luck. They insure their devotion by offering them incense and mark their allegiance by planting clan arrows into the conical structure that dominated the Laptse area.

Incredibly soft to the touch, these luxurious, hard-wearing blankets are made to last for generations.

"Sagadawa, the fourth lunar month of the year, is the holiest in the Buddhist calendar.

It is said that any merit acquired during Sagadawa is multiplied manifold, and many Buddhist dedicate the month to acquiring merit. It is a time to stock up on merit, a spiritual investment towards the next life, and many commitments are made, for the whole month, sometimes longer.

When Norlha’s atelier opened, most women could spin within days, though many had never even tried.

"As in all nomadic communities, felting was a part of daily existence, and every woman learned to felt the wool they sheared from their sheep, making mats and boots, which they colorfully decorated. We were lucky that so many people in Ritoma were talented felters. Norlha put yak felting on the map in 2012. 

Yak khullu is a short fiber, not considered suitable for felting or spinning. By adding modern equipment, we found that we could combine innovative technology and timeless know how in producing the first high quality yak felt. The life long experience of the Ritoma women with hand felting, coupled with their ingenuity, helped to create a quality of felt, soft and even, beyond anyone’s expectations which is now used to make fabrics and finished products.

"We interviewed Dorjee Dhundup about the significance, rituals and traditions held during Laptse. 

‘This year, I donated the animal, which we call a Tsethar, meaning ‘Life that has been spared’. It is my attempt at negating the negative karma I accumulated as a nomad, having to kill for my livelihood over many years. I pledge to take good care of this animal until it dies of natural causes at a ripe old age, making sure it is well fed and protected from wolves.’ You can distinguish Tsethar yaks as they are dressed with prayer flags.

"Launching our latest collection of luxurious yak wool garments and scarves for spring and summer, offering soft, breathable and lightweight pieces for the warmer months. 

Situated in the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau, Norlha is profoundly influenced and led by its environment and the nomadic culture that has existed in Tibet for thousands of years. Reflecting this connection, Norlha is launching its first collection of the year alongside the Laptse Festival of Ritoma Village, an auspicious holiday that pays homage to the local deity Amnye Dongra and marks a day of peace and new beginnings. 

The pieces in this collection gesture towards traditional Tibetan dress, with colors echoing the tones of the Tibetan landscape when the sun bleaches the grass and the days are bright and long. As with all Norlha items, each garment is impeccably handwoven at Norlha Atelier on the Tibetan Plateau by highly skilled artisans using sustainable processes.

"Women’s day, a day for reflection on the role, status and achievements of women in our world. Though Tibetan nomadic society is mostly patriarchal and male influence pervades, women’s role in society benefits from the status accorded to the female deities, enlightened beings and Bodhisattvas that abound in the Tibetan Buddhist pantheon, protecting and aiding practitioners on the path to enlightenment. The core purpose of Mahayana Buddhist practice is to renounce one’s personal welfare and seek to release all sentient beings from suffering. Tantric Buddhism provides the fastest path through the cultivation of wisdom, the female element, and compassion, the male one, which united into one will cause the attainment of this ultimate goal.

Female deities are said to appear in realized being’s visions and dreams, appearing in their lives in the guise of ordinary humans. Many are just born as women and can be recognized and revered, or just remain hidden, revealing their powers only when they choose to do so.

This pervading presence of deified or holy human females that permeates the culture at the esoteric level becomes a natural channel for women breaking barriers in society, especially today, when they gradually gain independence from their families and establish themselves in the work environment. In Ritoma, the home of the Norlha Atelier has seen local women take charge of their lives, giving a chance to those who cannot rely on their immediate families for support, adding another layer to female presence and capability.

"Long Felt Vest ~ To create the vest, the Khullu fibre is dampened with water and soap, which acts as a binding agent, matting the fibres together. The artisans then begin rolling and flattening out the fibre with their hands to form the vest over the next seven hours. 
After the rolling is complete and the felt vest is formed, it is washed to remove the soap and to make sure the fibres have “set” so the vest retains its shape and dimensions with any future washings. It is then left to dry for six to seven hours before it is ironed. This vest has been created using a unique, zero-waste process mastered by Norlha artisans.

Hand-felted and moulded at Norlha Atelier using a zero-waste process, this piece demonstrates remarkable craftsmanship and skill. With seamless pockets and a high neck, the vest’s lighter yak wool forms a cross-shaped design which traces the circumference of the body.

The khullu used to make this vest is a rare fibre, as only one in every hundred yak possesses a grey coat.",/workspaces/SMA_Y_Bhutan/data/analysis/Norla Atelier IG Photos/2744510565470405423_1580798609.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,1140,1,0,norlha_atelier
"As 2021 comes to a close, we look back with pride at the trajectory and challenges that we rode during this second pandemic marked year. Spread out over four continents, Asia, North and South America and Europe, our team coordinated daily to sustain Norlha’s mission of empowering a local community as artists of the rare Yak Khullu through our ethical Tibetan Enterprise. 

As a small-scale enterprise, the key to Norlha’s long term success is our commitment to being a circular business, driven by a strategy of values, primarily, value over volume. We strive to raise the value of our nature and culture through a sustainable enterprise where natural and monetary resources are regenerative, not exploitive. At Norlha, we believe in positive luxury.

Our focus in 2021, has been a continuation of our commitment to the Norlha community spanning from the makers of our products to our customers around the world. We are honored and humbled by B-corp for our ‘Best of the World’ award, a recognition for being a part of the top 10 percentile of companies who make the greatest community impact in the world. As we completed our 14th year at Norlha, we celebrated this award with 15 more artisans who completed 10 years with us, training and perfecting their skills to maturity.

The dedication of our artists was matched by our trainers in technique, design and marketing, who joined us from around the world, working through different time zones carried by our shared belief in the exceptional qualities of yak fiber. Norlha became a virtual bridge of cultural exchange as artisans on the Tibetan Plateau worked with designers and fellow artisans spread out over the globe. The launch of each collection saw an improvement of products rather than seeking yearly novelty. The year concluded with customers from 32 different countries, broadening our community of people who believe and support our creation of Values and Value over volume. We want to give our heartfelt thanks to each and every owner of a Norlha creation; one that can last a lifetime and be passed down over generations.

"Felting is an ancient craft, a way of binding fibres to form fabrics and rugs for everyday use. It was highly developed among nomadic populations in Central Asia and the Caucasus where pieces over two thousand years old have been found. Among the nomads of Central Asia, felt, which is waterproof, provided shelter in the form of tents, clothing and rugs, many of which were intricately ornamented. As in all nomadic communities, felting was a part of daily existence in Ritoma, where all women learned to felt the wool they sheared from their sheep, making mats for sitting and sleeping, boots, raincoats and hats. 

Sixteen women felt at Norlha. All of them were nomads as some point in their lives, and their long experience and ingenuity with hand felting coupled help from innovative technology made it possible to create the first felted yak khullu products for the home; contemporary in look, unique to the touch, soft and long lasting.
