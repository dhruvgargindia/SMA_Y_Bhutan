kelzangtextiles,"We managed to get Pala model our new organic hand spun cotton and nettle totes next to his shop today. Needless to say he nailed it. Looking smart in his impeccable work clothes. We are thrilled to have Pala here because we have been neighbors for 30 odd years and still counting. Pala’s little shop is just as it was during the early nineties,the treats and the candies still in the old vintage jars. As retro as it can get. A little corner of nostalgia and happinesses. We wish Pala good health and hoping we remain neighbors for many more years to come. 

P.s- The cotton is grown and hand spun in Pemagatshel in eastern Bhutan and can be sourced in scarce quantity.

kelzangtextiles,"Our grandparents in the village would often mention the concept of extracting various hues from the natural world. Initially, this was met with skepticism, as people could not fathom such a process. However, as time progressed, we learned and took part in the process of natural dyeing. This process of natural dyeing endorsed the claims of our grandparents and their way of life. Nature presents itself as an extraordinary endowment. Our venture into dyeing has led us to utilize wild berries, which has resulted in an exceptional chromatic outcome.

kelzangtextiles,"We are on our 12th day of our first lockdown. Kelzang is making best use of her time teaching her daughters and nieces how to weave. Even though, the pandemic has considerably affected our business, we are continuing working with few of our weavers and is keeping an optimistic view that things will return back to normal soon. We are extremely fortunate and blessed to have our beloved king takecare of us in this difficult time. We hope there are people taking care of people in need 💫. We would like to thank @indagaretravel for giving us an opportunity to connect to a wider audience and for promoting our work through zoom global classroom 🙌🏼. @selvedgemagazine for giving us the privilege to participate in 2020 Virtual Selvedge World Fair in September 🙌🏼.

The ground is embellished with diamond shaped ‘kushu’ motifs such as those decorating women’s ‘kushuthara’ dresses and sometimes called ‘ kushu bundri’. Definitely one of our favorite collection at the shop 😍💫.

Norbu Choden
Age-57

Went to see Norbu today at her home where she is weaving one of our vegetable dyed silk ‘Rachu’. She has been with us as long as we were around that is some odd 24 years. Wooh! Norbu is from Pema Gatshel in Eastern Bhutan. She was taught how to weave by her mother and started weaving since a little 8 year old girl. She has never married and has no children but has taken care of her parents and relatives making a living out of weaving. 
Proud to have Norbu as one of our talented Weaver. ✨
