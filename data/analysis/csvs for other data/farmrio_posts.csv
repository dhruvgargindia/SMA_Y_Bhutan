farmrio,"FARM RIO <3 YAWANAWA: Seven years ago, we embarked on a transformative journey from our hometown, Rio de Janeiro, to the indigenous territory of Rio Gregório within the Amazon rainforest. During our visit, we had the opportunity to meet the Yawanawa women who forever transformed our relationship with nature and our feminine essence. 

Over time, our relationship has blossomed in many ways. We’ve started a creative collaboration with the artisans, showcasing and selling their bead jewelry and later evolving into creating collaborative capsule collections. Yet, our most significant collective accomplishment is empowering 180 women through direct income generation. These talented women emerged as the primary providers for their households and are now sparking a shift in gender roles with positive impacts for future generations.

farmrio,"This year, our long-lasting partnership with the Yawanawa women turns a new leaf as we introduce a new collaborative capsule with pieces that are living stories of their land and culture. One of them is called Rauti. 

While carrying the timeless wisdom of the forest, the vibrant beaded compositions of the Yawanawa also represent a recent expression. They embody a path of female empowerment within the community—one of the few in Brasil led by a female pajé (spiritual leader). Additionally, they embrace a new understanding of rauti, a profoundly meaningful term that translates to ‘ornaments of beauty and protection.’. 

But rauti goes far beyond a piece of jewelry: ‘It is everything that enhances beauty. When I’m in rauti, there’s nothing I fear. It adorns and protects simultaneously.’ explains Júlia Yawanawa, coordinator of the Rauti Project.

walking on crispy leaves,

dripping from the bluebird sky,
becoming colorful,
with every smile.
